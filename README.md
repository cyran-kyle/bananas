Bananas Screen Sharing is a simple and
easy-to-use screen sharing tool for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

It utilizes a peer-to-peer connection to share your screen with others,
without the need for an account or any server infrastructure
(except for the stun, turn and signaling servers that are needed for exchanging the initial connection information)
